## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check existing issues as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible:

* Use a clear and descriptive title
* Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem
* Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps
* Describe the behavior you observed and what behavior you expected
* Include screenshots if relevant
* Include your environment details (OS, Python version, etc.)

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion, please include:

* A clear and descriptive title
* A detailed description of the proposed enhancement
* Explain why this enhancement would be useful
* List any similar features in other projects

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. Ensure the test suite passes
4. Make sure your code follows the style guidelines
5. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-agents-cybersecurity.git
cd ai-agents-cybersecurity

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Run tests
pytest
```

## Style Guidelines

### Python Style Guide

We use Black for code formatting and follow PEP 8:

```bash
# Format your code
black .

# Check linting
flake8 .

# Type checking
mypy .
```

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Example:
```
Add SOAR integration for ServiceNow

- Implement webhook handler for incident creation
- Add authentication module for OAuth2
- Include retry logic for API failures

Fixes #123
```

### Documentation

* Use Markdown for documentation
* Include docstrings for all public functions
* Update README.md if you change functionality
* Add examples for new features

### Testing

* Write unit tests for new functionality
* Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
* Aim for >80% code coverage
* Include integration tests for API changes

## Project Structure

When adding new features, follow the existing structure:

```
chapter-examples/chXX-topic/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md           # Explain the feature
â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py        # Module initialization
â”œâ”€â”€ core.py            # Core implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ config.py          # Configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/             # Test files
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test_core.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test_integration.py
â””â”€â”€ examples/          # Usage examples
```

## Security Considerations

* Never commit secrets or API keys
* Use environment variables for configuration
* Validate all inputs
* Follow OWASP secure coding practices
* Report security vulnerabilities privately to security@aiagentscybersecurity.com

## Code Review Process

All submissions require review before merging:

1. Automated checks must pass (tests, linting, security scan)
2. At least one maintainer approval required
3. No merge conflicts with main branch
4. Documentation updated if needed
